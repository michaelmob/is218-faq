# User Stories

1. I want to be able to show my appreciation for an answer.
2. As a user of the FAQ website, I want to to click a 'clap' button as many
   times as I want to show enthusiasm for an answer.
3. It would be handy if this button was right below the answer.
4. I also should be able to see who provided the answer and a link to their profile.
5. I want to NOT be bugged by an annoying popup to register/login (like on Quora)


# Epics

I am constantly looking up frequently asked questions on websites such as Quora
and NJIT FAQ. On Quora, this annoying popup comes up for me to register every
single time I load a page.  I can only give a single up vote per answer on
Quora and that makes me sad. I would like to be able to give it as many up
votes as I want to so that I can show how much I appreciate the answer that
was provided to a question. Being able to click a button as many times as I'd
like sounds like the perfect solution. It will be as if I am 'clapping' and
I am the audience to the answer.
